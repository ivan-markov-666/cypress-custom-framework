 *                  The spec (test) classes inside this "3.RealExample" folder contain the same test implemented differently.
 *                  Spec (test) classes are the classes where we describe the automation tests. We use the default Cypress testing frame (Mocha) in this framework. For more details, please refer to the official Cypress documentation.
 *                  We can use a few approaches to create our automation tests.
 *                  You can start with the first example and continue with the next one.
 *                  The first example is - the worst practice that we can use. The last example is the best (extreme) practice we can use for creating spec (test) classes.
 *                  The best practice is in example 10. However, there is an extreme best practice (in example 11).
 * 
 *                  After version 10 of Cypress, the [filename].spec.[ext] files are renamed to [filename].cy.[ext].
