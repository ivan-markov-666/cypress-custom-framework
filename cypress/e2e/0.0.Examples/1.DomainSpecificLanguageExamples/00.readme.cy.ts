/**
 * @description         
 *                  The classes inside the "1.DomainSpecificLanguageExamples" folder contain examples of the most common cases we can meet during the automation process.
 *                  All examples are used to create the domain-specific language functions from the low-level (custom Cypress commands) located inside the "DomainSpecificLanguage-LowLevel" folder. 
 *                  Inside these classes, we use default Cypress commands (most of them are default, some are custom).
 *                  You can use the examples for training.
 *                  ! Alert ! Those examples are not all methods we can find in the domain-specific language from a low level (custom Cypress commands).
